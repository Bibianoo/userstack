# UserAgent API has been relaunched as userstack

Great news! After months of work we're happy to announce that your long trusted UserAgent API product has been rebuilt completely, extended in functionality and relaunched under a new name - userstack. With multiple data updates per week, lightning-fast API responses, a series of new features and an overall more intuitive user experience we are making an effort to offer a new, advanced API platform to better serve our loyal base of customers. 

## Switch to the new API now

To ensure a smooth transition process, please make sure to [sign up for a free userstack API account](https://userstack.com/product) now, get your API access key and adjust your application to make use of the new userstack API endpoint. 

## Drop-in replacement! 

The newly launched userstack API will act as a drop-in replacement for your current API integration. The new API endpoint will feature a "legacy" parameter that causes the userstack API to return API results in exactly the same format that was used in UserAgent API results. 

To learn more about how to enable legacy format, please refer to the [userstack API Documentation](https://userstack.com/documentation#enable_legacy_format).

## Shutdown of UserAgent API endpoints

Until January 31st you will still be able to use the now discontinued UserAgent API endpoint. However, to prevent service disruption please make sure to create an account with userstack soon and switch to the new userstack API endpoint. 

We look forward to welcoming you as a new userstack customer!
